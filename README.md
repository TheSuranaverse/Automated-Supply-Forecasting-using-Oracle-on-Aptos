# 🧠 Automated Supply Forecasting Smart Contract

## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements a decentralized supply forecasting system on the **Aptos blockchain** that leverages **oracle data** to automatically optimize inventory management. The smart contract analyzes current supply levels and market demand to generate optimal forecasts, helping businesses maintain ideal inventory levels.

---

## 📄 Project Description

The **Automated Supply Forecasting** system is a **Move smart contract** built on Aptos that addresses the critical challenge of inventory management. By processing oracle data concerning market demand and current supply levels, the contract automatically calculates optimal future supply requirements.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Demand-Based Forecasting**: Automatically calculates optimal supply levels based on current market demand.
- **Adaptive Algorithm**:
  - Increases forecasted supply by 20% when demand exceeds supply.
  - Maintains a 10% buffer when supply meets or exceeds demand.
- **Event-Driven Updates**: Emits events with each forecast update for transparent audit trails.
- **Access Controls**: Only the authorized owner can update forecasts, ensuring data integrity.
- **Data Validation**: Prevents invalid or malicious inputs.
- **View Functions**: Read-only access to forecast data without modifying blockchain state.

---

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

The smart contract consists of two main functions:

- `initialize`: Sets up the forecasting system for a product with initial supply and demand data.
- `update_forecast`: Updates oracle data and recalculates the forecasted supply.

The forecasting algorithm adapts to market conditions, providing actionable inventory insights for businesses.

---

## 🌍 Project Vision

Our vision is to revolutionize supply chain management by leveraging blockchain technology and oracle data to create more **efficient**, **transparent**, and **responsive** inventory systems.

---

## ❗ Problem Statement

Traditional inventory systems suffer from:

- Manual forecasting that's time-consuming and error-prone.
- Centralized platforms that create single points of failure.
- Lack of transparency among supply chain stakeholders.
- Slow reaction to market shifts leading to overstocking or stockouts.

---

## ✅ Solution

By implementing an automated forecasting system on Aptos, we aim to:

- **Reduce Waste**: Optimize inventory to avoid overproduction.
- **Increase Efficiency**: Automate repetitive forecasting tasks.
- **Enhance Transparency**: Store immutable records of supply forecasts.
- **Improve Responsiveness**: Leverage real-time oracle data.
- **Enable Interoperability**: Provide hooks for other on-chain supply systems.

---

## 🛣️ Future Roadmap

- **Advanced Algorithms**: Integrate machine learning for better predictions.
- **Multi-Factor Analysis**: Factor in seasonality, lead times, and external trends.
- **Cross-Chain Compatibility**: Support oracles from other blockchains.
- **Supply Chain Integration**: Connect with other decentralized logistics and inventory platforms.
- **Governance Framework**: Add community voting for future algorithm or parameter changes.
